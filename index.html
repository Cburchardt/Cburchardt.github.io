				<p style="color:black;">I grew up in Waukesha, Wisconsin. I went to Kettle Moraine high school and I played baseball and basketball. Sports have always been a part of my life. I love to be active weather thats playing sports, or working out. I also enjoy being outside and being in the sun. My favorite time of year is definitely the summer because I love lake days with my family and friends. </p>
