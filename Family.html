			<h2 style="color: black;">Family</h2>
			<main>
			<p style="color: black;"> My family is very important to me. I am very close with alot of my family members and we have made so many memories together. My immediate family consists of my brother and my parents. Growing up we would always do things together like playing board games, watching movies, or going on adventures. I am also close with my extended family. Both set of grandparents lived roughly an hour away when I was growing up so I would visit them often. We would see them on the holidays as well as for other events. Most of my cousins still live in Wisconsin as well so I sell them a couple times a year too. I am blessed to have such a close family who is very loving of each osther. </p>

				<h3>Parents</h3>
				<p> My parents are people that I look up to each day. I can not thank them enough for everything they have done for me so far in life. I had a great childhood growing up and we made awesome memories. My parents have been very supportive of me. From supporting me in youth sports to supporting me going to college. They have put in numerous hours of driving me and my brother to practices and games as well as helping us in the backyard. I remember my mom would hit us fly balls in the backyard before dinner and my dad would shoot hoops with us in the driveway. I could not be where I am today without them. </p>

				<h3>Brother</h3>
					<p>My brother is three years younger than me and is finishing up his senior year of high school. Next year he is planning to play baseball at Madison College. Growing up my brother and I were very close. We would play in the backyard together and practice our sports. I loved going to his sporting events and cheering him on. I was even able to help coach some of his teams. I am very thankful I had a brother to bond with over the years. Even though I am the older brother he is now taller and stronger than me. </p>

				<h3>Grandparents</h3>
				<p>I am very close with both of my pairs of grandparents. Over the holidays my family goes and visits my grandparents and other extended family. We usually have a routine so we can see everyone each year. While I was growing up I went on trips with my grandparents and we did many other fun activities. I remember going to Disney world and going to the Wisconsin Dells. Also my grandparents would watch me and my brother while my parents were away. They also would attend my sports games and cheer me on. I am super grateful for all  my memories with my grandparents. </p>
