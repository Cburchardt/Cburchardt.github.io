            <main>As you can probably tell, sports have been a part of my life ever since I was young. I grew up playing sports and I loved to watch others play and practice my skills. My parents were also big into sports and we would attend many games together, from the local teams to traveling across the country to watch out favorite teams play. Here I highlight some of my favorite sporting events which I have attended. </main>

                <h2>College World Series</h2> 
                <p> 
                    I have attended the College World Series (CWS) which is in Omaha, NE twice now. The first time was when I was 13, and I was playing in a baseball tournament in Omaha. We got tickets and attended a game. It was super fun to see the environment. But more recently I went two summers ago with my dad and brother. We went to 4 games while we were down there and got to watch the best college baseball teams. It was sunny each day and the environment was top notch. I was rooting for the Arkansas Razorbacks because Wisconsin doesn't have a team so I had to choose someone else. It was so fun to see all the different fans and how much energy there was in the city that weekend. I will definitely be going back.

                <h2>March Madness</h2> 
                <p> 
                    Another thing about my family is that we love college sports. I grew up watching college sports over the professionals. So another college event that we attended was March Madness. This is the big college basketball tournament in March and some of the games were played in Milwaukee years ago. My family went for two days and got to watch some great games. There were teams from all over the country so it was fun to meet new people. I would love to attend the final four one day.

                <h2>Brewer Playoff Game</h2> 
                <p> 
                 Back in high school I went to a Milwaukee Brewer playoff game with my grandpa. This was such a fun experience because I love baseball. I live close to Milwaukee so I have been to the Brewer games many times but the atmosphere for a playoff game was electric. It was such a good game and the Brewers won on a walk off. It was a sold out crowd and the loudest game I have ever been to. I hope I get to experience this again in the future.
