				<p style="color: black;">Some of my favorite memories in life are from vacations that I have took. I have traveled all over the country to multiple states. Below I highlight some of my favorite trips that I have taken. </p>

				<h3>Fort Myers Beach, Fl</h3>
				<p>I have been to Fort Myers Beach multiple times because my family just loves it so much. One time we went with my grandparents, aunt and cousin. And twice we have went with our family friends. Each time I went there were many different activities that I did. I played football on the beach with my friends and we also built a sand castle village. My family loves to watch the sunsets over the water at night and play games after dinner. </p>

				<h3>Vail, CO</h3>
				<p>This is my most recent trip as I went to Vail over winter break. I went with my girlfriend and we were both super excited to go. The travel was pretty long as the roads in Colorado were snow covered but after we finally got to the resort it was a great trip. I grew up skiing back home here in WI, but I have not been able to do it much recently. The first day that we hit the slopes there was 8 inches of fresh powdery snow. Skiing in fresh powder has always been a dream of mine and this trip was unforgettable. The views were beautiful and I had so much fun.

				<h3>Atlanta, GA</h3>
				<p>Over this past summer I traveled with my mom, brother, and girlfriend to ATL. My brother had a baseball tournament so we made a trip out of it. We went to a couple of his games and also went to different parts of the city. One day we walked at a national park and the other day we went shopping at the mall. At night we went downtown and went to the huge ferris wheel. It was so cool to see the city from above. It was so hot and humid this week but it was still super fun. </p>
